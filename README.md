Hello, I am an Electronic Engineer passionate about technology and software and hardware development. My objective is focused on developing skills in the design and integration of specific hardware components and custom software, mainly in mobile devices. Currently I am starting in the field of development on the Android platform, although at the moment I am Junior I improve my skills every day and I hope soon to handle languages such as Kotlin, Flutter, Swift and others for web development, Angular, Node Js & Vue Js.
